Platform for instant-on-gaming

This project aims to provide a simple platform to provide services to delevop and deploy games running on handheld devices.
The core is a CherryPy server distributing the games as HTML/JavaScript and serving as a backend for the game logic.

As a first proof-of-principle a multi-player ship management / survival game inspired by the Spaceteam game has been implemented.

To test it out, enter the server repository and run:

python gexusSever.py

and open type "http://<your server ip>:8080/" into your favorite web browser.
